**Abstract:** In the recent years, a series of measurements in the observables RK(\*) and RD(\*)
concerning the semileptonic decays of the B mesons have shown hints of violations of Lepton Flavour
Universality (LFU). An updated model-independent analysis of New Physics violating LFU, by using
the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) Lagrangian with semileptonic dimension six
operators at Λ = 1 TeV is presented. We perform a global fit, in order to assess the impact of the
New Physics in a broad range of observables including B-physics, electroweak precision test, Higgs
physics and nuclear β decays. We discuss the relevance of the mixing in the first generation for the
observables with heavier lepton flavours. We use for the first time in this context a Montecarlo analysis
of the likelihood function to extract the confidence intervals and correlations between observables. Our
results show that a suitable strategy is to use a Gradient Boosting predictor as a proxy of the real
likelihood function, and to analyze the SHAP values as a measure of the impact of each parameter of
SMEFT Lagrangian in the fit.
