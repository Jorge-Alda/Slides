**Abstract:** Light New Physics offers exciting oportunities for detection in current and future collider experiments. It is also theoretically well-motivated, addressing problems like Dark Matter and the strong CP problem. We are studying Axion-Like Particles in the mass range between some MeV and a few GeV, i.e., light (in the context of collider searches), and focus on their coupling to leptons. Since their interactions are proportional to the mass of the lepton, we study $\tau$ processes. We obtain a nice interplay between production of visible ALPs, invisible ALPs and indirect effects in $(g-2)_\tau$.
